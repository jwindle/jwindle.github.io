Hi!  I am a Data Scientist and Engineer based out of Kansas City.
Previously, I was Director of Data Science at [Hi Fidelity Genetics /
Technologies](https://www.hifidelitytechnologies.com/), a startup that
aimed to improve maize genetics through root system architecture
characteristics.  Below is a quick summary of my
[resume](/pdfs/jesse-windle-resume-2301-v4.pdf).


### Research and Professional Experience

- 2015-2023: Director of Data Science, Hi Fidelity Genetics /
  Technologies
- 2014-2015: Visiting Assistant Professor, Duke University


### Education and Training

- Postdoc: Duke University, Statistics, 2014
- PhD: University of Texas at Austin, Comp. and Appl. Mathematics, 2013
- BS: University of Nebraska – Lincoln, Mathematics, 2005
		
### Experience
		
As the first employee at Hi Fidelity Technologies I wore a lot of
different hats.  My experiences include:
		
- [Inventing](https://patents.google.com/patent/US11293910B2/) a device to measure a plant’s root system in the field.
- Using our device's data to [model](../2023/07/26/rootmodel.html) a root growth.
- Using DNA and RNA data to predict plant performance.
- Building the data engineering and data science platforms.
- Building out our entire team.
		
		
Some skills, briefly:
		
**Data Science**: Non-parametric models (i.e. “AI” and “ML”), structured
Bayesian modeling, standard tools like linear and mixed models, R, and
Python.
		
**Quantitative Genetics**: Genomic prediction with DNA and RNA data.
		
**Systems Engineering and Development**: RESTful Flask-based API,
Postgres, Apache Iceberg.
		
**Scientific Communication**: Reducing complex data to key metrics;
conveying results in high-level, graphical summaries.
		
**Management**: As employee #1, I helped build and manage our entire team.
